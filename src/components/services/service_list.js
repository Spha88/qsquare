        <p><p>The main focus of our Technical Support Services is three-fold, namely, <strong>Support Services</strong>, <strong>IT Governance</strong> and <strong>Cyber Security</strong>.</p><ul>
            <li>Our <strong>Support Services</strong> range from day-to-day Desktop Support, Network and Server Infrastructure installation, to advanced back-end configuration support. Proper installation, implementation and configuration of ICT infrastructure and services has always been the make or break point for most business organisations. Those who pay more attention to this critical part of the organisation, have very little systems glitches to worry about. We assist all our clients to do it right first time at all costs in all circumstances.</li>
            <li>The increasing demand for compliance and protection of personal information of staff members, and clients, requires elevated levels of awareness in the use of information technology services, and infrastructure. This necessitates a pre-set of rules to safeguard personnel, infrastructure and information against repudiated actions and foster accountability through <strong>IT Governance</strong>.   </li>
            <li>The levels of awareness around identity theft and risky online behaviour that could hurt both persons and organisations is contrastingly low compared to the frequency of reported cyber security threats. This makes <strong>Cyber Security</strong> not only relevant but a critical necessity for all organisations reliant on technology. Cyber Security forms part of our ICT Services suite with a special focus on protecting the online periphery.</li>
