                            South Africaâ€™s economy has historically been
                            designed and organised around certain industries,
                            like mining, thus leading to a skewed concentration
                            of expertise to the urban centers. As a result,
                            innovative solutions that could resolve rural
                            challenges are excluded from the mainstream economy.

                            Q-Squared Concepts (PTY) LTD aims to exploit this
                            gap between aspirant entrepreneurs and industry
                            experts through the development of digital platforms
                            for entrepreneurial collaboration and facilitate
                            business mentorship.

                            The key aim of the digital platforms is to afford
                            aspiring entrepreneurs who have innovative business
                            ideas, an opportunity to access expert professional
                            guidance and services.
